Suggests tags based on how commonly they occur together with the tags you have already added.

E.g:
```
#cs #dev #|
suggestions: #android, #web #js, ...
```
```
#journal #|
suggestions: #hobby, #stats, ...
```

One caveat: there appears to be no way to disable the built in suggestions that trigger when you type `#`, so to use this plugin, you have to start typing with `@` instead.
